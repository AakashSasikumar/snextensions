[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/53e5f0b7-02c9-400d-8590-159860892cdc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/snext/deploys)

A set of open source extensions for StandardNotes.

# Usage

Paste `https://snext.netlify.com/index.json` into `Extended Code` in StandardNotes.

# Notice

Currently we only host extensions developed by StandardNotes.
Some of the official extensions are not included.

# Contribution

If you'd like an extension to be included in this repository, feel free to open an issue.

# Self-hosting

If you'd like to host your own site instead of using ours:

- Fork this repository;
- Create a Netlify account if you don't have one already;
- In Netlify app, Use "New site from Git" to create a site from your forked GitHub repository;
- Wait for the build to finish;
- After that you can use `YOUR_SITE_URL/index.json` as an `Extended Code`;

Optionally you can set a human-readable site name (a subdomain of `netlify.com`) from the `Site settings` page.
